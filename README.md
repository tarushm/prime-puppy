# prime-puppy

A game, security check, and social app all rolled into one.

Prime Puppy involves a puppy on the beach on her way to Procore. She must avoid the giant bones by hopping through them.

The game is scored in two ways. You are able to see your high score, but you also have a Prime Score, which is equal to the number of primes less than your high score. This is calculated efficiently using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. 

Once you are satisfied with a high score, you are then able to choose the ENCRYPT option at the lower left of your screen. Here, you will be able to encrypt your score using an RSA encryption. Then, you will have the option to text a friend to decrypt your message!
